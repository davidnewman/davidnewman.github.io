This is the personal blog of Dave Newman, a New York based software engineer, administrator, and technologist of absolutely no note.

Dave has shipped software in C++, C#, and PHP on both Microsoft and Linux based systems. Dave routinely manages and architects systems that support tens of millions of users on both the Amazon and Rackspace clouds.

Dave earned a B.S. in Computer Science from [Kettering University](https://www.kettering.edu).

All views, statements, and expressions of frustration on this site are Dave's and do not reflect those of any employer past, present or future.
